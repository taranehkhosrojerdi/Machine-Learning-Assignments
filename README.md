This repository contains my practical assignments for the Machine Learning course lectured by Dr. Fatemeh Seyedsalehi on Spring 2024 semester.

The assignments include jupyter notebooks for the following topics:

1. Heart_Disease_Prediction: analyzing heart disease data, training a self-defined perceptron and a naive bayes model for predicting heart disease and evaluating the performance of each model.

2. MLE_MAP: Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Maximum A Postteriori estimation.

3. Polynomial_Regression: polynomial regression to model the relationship between the independent variable \( X \) and the dependent variable \( y \) and fine-tuning the degree of polynomial.

4. Regularization: Applying Lasso regularization (L1) and Ridge regularization (L2) on housing data and evaluating their results.

5. SVM: Self-defined soft SVM model, multiclass SVM, and different SVM kernels.

6. Classification: Classification with PyTorch on bank marketing dataset.

7. KNN: preprocessing data and implementation of KNN model from scratch.

8. kmeans: Using ELBO method and silhouette method to find optimal cluster number and comparing self-defined model with sklearn kmeans.

9. dimension_reduction: Implementation of PCA model and analyzing its results on a food dataset.
